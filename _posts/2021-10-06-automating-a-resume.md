I have automated the updating of htttps://resume.makersmasher.com using Github
Pages, and the npm tool https://jsonresume.org/.  It's pretty straightforward, 
I have a git repo, and a couple command line utilities that allow me to update
a resume.json file (and eventually a more targed json file conataining different 
keywords that pertain to teh job I want to go after); this will build a PDF and 
HTML version of my resume.
