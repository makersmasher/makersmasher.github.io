title: Automating a Resume

I have automated the updating of https://resume.makersmasher.com using Github
Pages, and the npm tool https://jsonresume.org/.  It's pretty straightforward, 
I have a git repo hosting the generated html, a couple command line utilities 
that allow me to update and generate a PDF or HTML from my resume.json file 
(and eventually a more targed json file containing different keywords that 
pertain to the job I want to go after).  A simple git commit and push updates 
the website.
