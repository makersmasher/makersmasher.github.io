## Hacking IoT Devices for Fun and Profit

One area that *really* interests me is hacking hardware; I have written "hello world"
bootloaders, and programmed NES games in C/6502 ASM but I haven't "red teamed"
too extensively.  This will be a log of that learning.

## Case Study AC2100 â€” Nighthawk AC2100 Smart WiFi Router

One of [BugCrowd's](https://bugcrowd.com/netgear) platforms that are available
to hack on is NETGEAR, specifically the NightHawk devices.  Rather than going 
out and buying one straight away I am going to start by auditing the firmware
that is free for download from the Netgear website.  I am not expecting to find
much as I would assume this has already been poured over, but it should still be 
a fun exercise.  

First things First, get the firmware, TBC...
