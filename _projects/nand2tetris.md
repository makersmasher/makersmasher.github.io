## The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles

As a 3-year college dropout, and mainly a self-taught hacker, I have always been
a bit insecure regarding my knowledge of the low level bits of how a computer works.
This is a record of my work buidling a computer from the ground up via the book
and coursera course <u>"The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer 
from First Principles"</u>.
