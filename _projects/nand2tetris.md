## Building a Modern Computer from First Principles

As a 3-year college dropout, and mainly a self-taught hacker, I have always been
a bit insecure regarding my knowledge of the low level bits of how a computer works.
This is a record of my work buidling a computer from the ground up via the book
and coursera course <u>"The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer 
From First Principles"</u>.


- Boolean algebra and boolean functions can be physically implemented using logic gates.
- Boolean operations are commutative, associated, and distributive.
- NOT(X OR Y) = NOT(x) AND NOT(y) - De Morgan laws.
- Any boolean function can be represented using an expression containing AND, OR and NOT operations.
- Gate logic - a technique for implementing boolean functions using logic gates.
- Types of logic gates - elementary: (nand, and, or, not), composite: (mux, adder).
